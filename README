/* one-line CSS (see http://neutroncreations.com/blog/single-line-vs-multi-line-css-plus-textmate-tips/) */
header h1 { float: left;  width: 155px; height: 50px;  }

/* Multiline CSS */
header h1 {
  float: left;
  width: 155px;
  height: 50px;
}

Which to choose? One line CSS is easier to scan through and saves space, but multi-line CSS is easier to grep and edit.

This script sets you up so you edit and save multi-line CSS, but when you turn folding on, everything´s compressed on one line so you can scan through it easier.

Controls are vim´s standard for text folding:
zo and zc: Open and Close fold (set multiline, set oneline)
zR and zM: Reopen and Close all (globally set multiline, globally set oneline)
zj, zk: go down and up a fold (CSS block).
